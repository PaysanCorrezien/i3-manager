# i3-manager

The `i3-manager` is a Bash script designed to manage your workspace in the i3 window manager. It comes with an interactive menu powered by `rofi`, from which you can choose different sets of applications to start, each on a specific workspace. You can also launch any other application and move running applications between workspaces.

This script relies on `i3-msg`, `xdotool`, `jq`, and `rofi` to function. You must have these tools installed on your system to use the script. It is designed for use with the i3 window manager, but it might work with other window managers that support the EWMH/NetWM standard.

## Customizing the Script

The `i3-manager` script is highly customizable. Here's what you can modify to adapt the script to your workflow:

- **Workspace assignments**: The script starts specific applications on specific workspaces. The workspace assignments are stored in the `personal_apps` and `professional_apps` associative arrays. You can edit these arrays to start your preferred applications on your preferred workspaces. The array keys are the executable names or full paths of the applications, and the array values are the workspace numbers. 

- **Application launch delay**: By default, the script waits for 1 second after starting each application before starting the next one. You can customize this delay for each application by adding entries to the `app_sleep_time` associative array. The keys of this array are the executable names or full paths of the applications, and the values are the delays in seconds.

- **Window class names**: For some applications (especially AppImages), the script might not be able to automatically determine the correct window class name. If this happens, you will need to manually find out the class name of the application window and add a mapping from the executable name to the class name in the script.

- **Rofi theme**: The script uses a custom Rofi theme for its menu. You can change the theme by editing the `rofi_theme` variable in the script. You will need to provide the full path of your `.rasi` theme file.

## How to Use

To use the script, you simply need to run it in a terminal. It will display a menu with four options: "Personal", "Professional", "Launch app", and "List and move apps". 

- "Personal" and "Professional" will start the corresponding set of applications as defined in `personal_apps` and `professional_apps`.

- "Launch app" allows you to choose any other application to start on a specific workspace.

- "List and move apps" allows you to move running applications between workspaces.
